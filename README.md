# ME0021-Biomechanics-Project
This repository includes code for the ME0021 Fall 2021 Biomechanics Project. The goal of this project was to find and analyze the net reaction forces and moments at the ankle, knee, and hip during the stance phase of a gait cycle. This was achieved via modeling the human body as rigid links connected through pins and using inverse dynamics analysis. 

Files included in this repository: 

*Biomechanics COMPLETE.pdf - Free body diagrams of the thigh, shank and foot, equations of motion, and calculated forces and moments of each segment. 

*HBP_input_stance_corrected - data for body segment coordinates, accelerations, inertias, and moments for 79 various data points. These data points were used in calculating the forces and moments and were gathered prior to the project via body motion sensors.

*Biomechanics_Code.m - Matlab code for the equations of motion and generating unknown moments and forces along with their graphs. 

*Biomechanics Final Report.pdf - Final report for class assignment with introduction, methods, results, and discussion.
